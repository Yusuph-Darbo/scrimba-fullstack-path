##  Overview

This webiste is a fully interactive front-end project that simulates a simple online ordering experience for a restaurant.

Users can view a list of dishes (burgers, pizzas, and more), add or remove items from their order, view the total price, and complete their purchase through a mock payment form with basic input validation.

The project focuses on DOM manipulation, modular JavaScript, and responsive layout design — all implemented without any external frameworks.
